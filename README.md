# sock5_2_http_proxy
This is a tool written in pure python to transform the sock5 proxy to http proxy.
It can be used in any where python can be used for personal use.
And this is an alpha version, need more test.
The https part is not tested, but seems to work.

The python_proxy.py and the socks.py are written by
xxx, and xxx
(I'll add this part laterly)

require: python2.7+

To run it:
cd PATH/TO/WHERE/main.py/EXISTS
python main.py

then you can get a proxy at 8080, which use a sock5 proxy at 7070
Those port can be changed easily, if you can understand python, and the project is only for
personal usage, so I won't do this part.
